# Classification-of-App-Reviews

Collaborated in a team of three to create a web-app to classify user app reviews into 3 different categories(Python/Flask/ML).
<li> Used Naive Bayes Supervised Algorithm to train the data and classify the data into bug reports, feature requests, and sentiments.</li>
<li> Integrated the machine learning model into the Flask application, allowing users to enter text inputs and receive instant sentiment predictions.</li> 
<li> Strict adherence to coding guidelines and meticulous documentation practices were consistently maintained.</li>
